# DFS - PreOrder
## Steeps - Recursively

1. Create a variable to store the values of nodes vidited
2. Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
3. Write a helper function which accepts a node
    1. Push a value of the node to the variable that stores the values
    2. If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
    3. If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
    4. Invoke the helper function with the current variable

4. Return the variable that store the values of nodes visited

# DFS - PostOrder
## Steeps - Recursively

1. Create a variable to store the values of nodes vidited
2. Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
3. Write a helper function which accepts a node
    1. If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
    2. If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
    3. Push a value of the node to the variable that stores the values
    4. Invoke the helper function with the current variable

4. Return the variable that store the values of nodes visited
